# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Project
Codeacademy U.S. Medical Insurance Project
We have been given the data set of the Medical Insurance records to analyze the set of parameters affecting the insurance costs or charges. There are 1339 lines in the dataset corresponding to the amount of client's records. Each client has the following parameters:
age - age of primary beneficiary 
sex - insurance contractor gender, female, male 
bmi - body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 
children - Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents 
smoker - Smoking (yes/no)
region - the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. 
charges - Individual medical costs billed by health insurance 

The project goal which was set for the analysis by the analyst:  

Define the most comfortable place for living in the US in terms of medical costs.  What is the cheapest and what is the most expensive region for medical expenses? How does the region affect the medical costs for all categories of clients? Hypotesys is that the most expensive region is the North West region due to overweight of the higher income population and higher medical prices.
